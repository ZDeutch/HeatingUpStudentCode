I want to create an array which will serve as the nodes for my graph. Then I need to add them to the graph based on whether the next temperature is greater or smaller. Once I have thetable sorted, then I can find the shortest path from the first node to the last node, and return the edges + 1. I am not yet sure how I will divy up the layers of my graph, and that will be the hardest part of this algorithm. |
| January 17  |        10:00 - 12:00 pm         | In order to code the longest increasing subsequence, each new temperature should be treated with the question "Should I extend my existing trend from previous day's or start a new trend" If the temperature is the lowest or very low in your set, the latter option may make more sense, but if it is high enough, then the former would make sense. The challenge is that at any given day, you might have multiple wrming trends of different length that need tracking, so you need to decide which one to extend. One way that I am thinking about this is by using an array which takes all the current information and finds the longest trend that ends on this specific day. Then every new piece of information can simply extend the previous trend. I imagine that there is a pretty big efficiency challenge in this problem. For each day you check all previous days, you effectively have an O(n2) solution which becomes unmanageable as you reach 100,000 temperatures. To optimize this, I think you would need to have an array of the smallest ending temperatures for all warming trends. Maybe there is a way to implement binary search where you sort all the temperatures, and then you can disqualify the temperatures based on the day that they occur. |

The basic process for constructing this was to use the list to track which days each temperature could possibly go to next, an integer array to see how many previous days point to any given day, and then a seperate array to track the longest warming trend that ends at each specific day. This is what I guess is refered to online as dynamic programming. Anyways, some of the biggest problems I encountered was how to actually find the length of the warming trend at any given temperature. I solved this by using a queue, where I would start with the coldest temperatures, and then look at which option is best, using the current temperature and going to the next possible day from there, and building the longest possible path by incrementing dp at that index as many times as possible. Once every node goes through this progress, then you simply find the maxLength in dp and return that. I pretty complex overall algorithm that works well with easy subcomponents. |
